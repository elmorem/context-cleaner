**CLI Commands Available:**
```bash
# Discovery and planning
context-cleaner migration discover-jsonl --path /data --output manifest.json

# Execute migration
context-cleaner migration migrate-historical --manifest manifest.json --batch-size 2000

# Monitor progress
context-cleaner migration migration-status --show-progress --show-errors

# Resume interrupted migration
context-cleaner migration resume-migration --checkpoint checkpoint.json

# Validate migration results
context-cleaner migration validate-migration --verify-counts --check-integrity

# Manage migration data
context-cleaner migration manage --list-checkpoints --cleanup-old
```

### 7. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/migration/`)
- **Unit tests** for all components with mock dependencies
- **Integration tests** with realistic data scenarios
- **Performance tests** for large dataset handling
- **Error recovery tests** with checkpoint and resume functionality
- **End-to-end tests** validating complete migration workflows

**Test Coverage:**
- Discovery service: File scanning, integrity checking, manifest generation
- Data extraction: JSONL parsing, schema handling, concurrent processing  
- Migration engine: Workflow orchestration, batch processing, error handling
- Progress tracking: Real-time monitoring, checkpoint management
- Validation: Pre/post migration checks, cross-validation
- CLI integration: Command execution, error handling, output formatting

## Key Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- **Target Performance**: 10,000+ records/second processing rate
- **Memory Efficiency**: Configurable memory limits (default 1.5GB)
- **Concurrent Processing**: Up to 3-5 files processed simultaneously
- **Batch Processing**: 1000-5000 record batches for optimal database insertion

### Reliability
- **Resume Capability**: Checkpoint-based recovery from any point
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and recovery
- **Data Validation**: Multi-tier validation with configurable tolerances
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing despite individual file failures

### Production Readiness
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operational logs with structured information
- **Monitoring Integration**: Dashboard-compatible progress reporting
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration with reasonable defaults
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU usage monitoring and limits

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Token Analysis Bridge**: Seamless integration with established bridge service
- **ClickHouse Database**: Uses existing client and connection management
- **SessionTokenMetrics**: Compatible with existing data models
- **Dashboard**: Progress display integration with existing dashboard components

### CLI Integration

# Dry run migration to test without actual data changes
context-cleaner migration migrate-historical --manifest manifest.json --dry-run

# Resume interrupted migration from checkpoint
context-cleaner migration resume-migration --checkpoint checkpoint_20250909_143022
