## üó∫Ô∏è Updated Roadmap
### Immediate Next Steps (Next Session)
1. **Process Optimization**: Review and potentially consolidate the 50+ background processes for better resource management
2. **Dashboard Consolidation**: Assess whether multiple dashboard instances (ports 8080-9002) are necessary or can be streamlined
3. **Service Health Check**: Implement monitoring for the numerous bridge sync and dashboard processes
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance metrics for the current multi-process architecture

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize background process management and resource utilization
- **Service Orchestration Enhancement**: Implement better coordination between multiple service instances
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create centralized monitoring for all running services
- **Process Lifecycle Management**: Implement proper startup, shutdown, and restart procedures

- **Privacy System**: Local-only processing with PII sanitization
- **Context Optimization**: Multi-strategy context cleaning with effectiveness tracking

## üö® Known Issues & Blockers
### Resource Management
- **High Process Count**: 50+ background processes may be consuming excessive system resources
- **Port Conflicts**: Multiple services attempting to bind to similar port ranges (8080-9002)
- **Process Coordination**: No apparent centralized coordination between multiple service instances

### Service Health
- **Process Monitoring**: No clear visibility into health status of numerous background processes
- **Failure Recovery**: Unclear how system handles individual service failures with so many instances
- **Resource Cleanup**: Potential resource leaks with multiple long-running processes

### Operational Concerns
- **Deployment Complexity**: Current architecture may be difficult to deploy and manage in production
- **Debugging Challenges**: Troubleshooting issues across 50+ processes could be complex
- **Configuration Management**: Managing configuration across multiple service instances

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session
