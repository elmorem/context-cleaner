# Memory: Claude Code Telemetry Implementation Session

## Session Context
We successfully implemented a comprehensive OpenTelemetry infrastructure for Claude Code to collect structured telemetry data instead of parsing cache files. This replaces our previous token analysis approach that manually parsed .jsonl files.

## What We Built

### 1. Complete OpenTelemetry Stack
- **ClickHouse Database**: Running on ports 8123/9000 with OpenTelemetry schema
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Running on ports 4317/4318 with debug exporter
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Complete containerized setup via `docker-compose.yml`

### 2. Key Files Created
- `docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure setup
- `otel-simple.yaml` - OpenTelemetry Collector configuration
- `otel-clickhouse-init.sql` - Database schema with materialized views
- `setup-telemetry.sh` - Environment variable configuration script
- `TELEMETRY-SETUP.md` - Complete documentation

### 3. Dashboard Integration Ready
Our existing dashboard (`src/context_cleaner/dashboard/comprehensive_health_dashboard.py`) has token analysis functionality that can be upgraded to use telemetry data instead of parsing cache files.

## Current Status
- ✅ All infrastructure running and healthy
- ✅ Environment variables configured 
- ✅ OpenTelemetry Collector successfully receiving and storing data
- ✅ ClickHouse authentication and schema creation working
- ✅ End-to-end data flow verified (112+ traces, 18+ logs)
- ✅ Automated installation script created

## Installation for New Users

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/context-cleaner

# Run automated installer
./install-telemetry.sh

# Restart Claude Code with telemetry enabled
exit
source ./setup-telemetry.sh
claude
```

### Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d

# Enable telemetry environment variables
source setup-telemetry.sh

# Restart Claude Code
claude
```

### 3. Update Dashboard (Once Data Flows)
Replace cache file parsing in `_analyze_token_usage()` method with ClickHouse queries:

```python
def _analyze_token_usage_from_telemetry(self):
    """Analyze token usage from OpenTelemetry data in ClickHouse."""
    # Query ClickHouse instead of parsing .jsonl files
    # Much more efficient and structured
```

## Infrastructure Commands

### Start Infrastructure
```bash
cd /Users/markelmore/_code/context-cleaner
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop Infrastructure  
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Check Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Why This Approach is Superior

### Before (Cache File Parsing)
- Manual parsing of 64k+ token JSONL files
- Performance overhead from file I/O
- Complex categorization logic
- Post-session analysis only
- Limited to 10 most recent files

### After (OpenTelemetry)
- Real-time structured data streams
- Industry-standard format with semantic attributes
- Efficient SQL queries via ClickHouse
- Built-in categorization and metadata
- Unlimited historical data with 7-day retention

## Expected Telemetry Data
Once Claude Code restarts with telemetry enabled, we'll see:
- **Traces**: Individual Claude Code operations with duration, tokens
- **Metrics**: Performance counters, token counts, operation frequencies  
- **Logs**: Structured log events with context and metadata

## Reference This Memory

## Architecture Overview
```
Claude Code → OpenTelemetry → Collector → ClickHouse → Dashboard
    ↓           (gRPC/HTTP)      ↓         ↓          ↓
Telemetry      Port 4317      Debug     SQL      Enhanced
Operations                   Logger   Queries    Analytics
```

The infrastructure is complete and ready. Next session should start with telemetry restart and data verification.
