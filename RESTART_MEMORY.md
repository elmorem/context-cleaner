# Context Cleaner - Restart Memory

## Current Status (August 29, 2025 - 5:05 PM)

### ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED: v0.1.0 LIVE ON PyPI! 🎉

**Context Cleaner v0.1.0 is now officially available on PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/context-cleaner/0.1.0/

Users can install with: `pip install context-cleaner`

---

## Current Phase: Phase 3 - Performance Optimization & User Feedback Integration (PR6)

**Goal**: Production hardening based on real user feedback now that package is live

### ✅ COMPLETED TODAY:
1. **PyPI Distribution Complete** - Package successfully uploaded to both Test PyPI and production PyPI
2. **Memory Optimization Module** - Created advanced `src/context_cleaner/optimization/memory_optimizer.py` with:
   - LRU Cache with intelligent eviction
   - Memory monitoring to maintain <50MB active usage
   - Weak reference management
   - Automated cleanup tasks
3. **CPU Optimization Module** - Created `src/context_cleaner/optimization/cpu_optimizer.py` with:
   - Adaptive task scheduler maintaining <5% CPU usage
   - Task priority management (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Intelligent throttling (4 levels: none, light, moderate, aggressive)
   - Background processing with circuit breaker protection

### 🚧 CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS:
- **Real-Time Performance Dashboard** - Started creating `src/context_cleaner/dashboard/real_time_performance_dashboard.py`
  - WebSocket-based real-time updates
  - Interactive performance controls
  - Memory and CPU monitoring with alerts
  - **STATUS**: File creation was interrupted - needs completion

### 📋 TODO LIST STATUS:
```
✅ Start Phase 3: Performance Optimization & User Feedback Integration (PR6)
✅ Implement memory usage optimization (<50MB active) 
✅ Implement CPU usage minimization (<5% background)
🚧 Build real-time performance monitoring dashboard (IN PROGRESS)
⏳ Create user feedback collection system (PENDING)
⏳ Add performance profiling and bottleneck analysis (PENDING)
```

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

### 1. Complete Real-Time Performance Dashboard
**File**: `src/context_cleaner/dashboard/real_time_performance_dashboard.py`
**Status**: Partially written, needs completion

**What to do**: 
- Complete the dashboard file creation (was interrupted)
- Create HTML template with real-time charts and controls
- Test integration with memory and CPU optimizers
- Add WebSocket functionality for live updates

### 2. Create User Feedback Collection System
**Goal**: Privacy-first feedback system for real users now that package is live
**Features needed**:
- Anonymous usage pattern collection
- Performance impact measurement  
- User satisfaction tracking
- Privacy-compliant data handling (GDPR/CCPA)

### 3. Performance Profiling and Bottleneck Analysis
**Goal**: Real-world performance analysis for live users
**Features needed**:
- Automated bottleneck detection
- Performance regression analysis
- Optimization recommendation engine
- Impact measurement tools

## USER FEEDBACK PRIORITY:

Now that v0.1.0 is live, we need to prioritize user feedback collection:

1. **Monitor PyPI download statistics**
2. **Track installation success rates** 
3. **Collect performance impact data**
4. **Gather user satisfaction feedback**
5. **Identify common usage patterns**

This feedback will drive Phase 3 completion and Phase 4 planning.

---

## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
- **Python 3.8+** required
- **Main dependencies**: Flask, SocketIO, psutil, threading, asyncio
- **Project structure**: Standard Python package with src/ layout
