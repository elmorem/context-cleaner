## Critical Risk Analysis

### Risk #1: Data Corruption During Migration
- **Probability**: 6/10 (Medium-High)
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Category**: Technical/Security
- **Description**: Historical data migration of 2.768B tokens could result in data corruption or loss during transfer to ClickHouse database

#### Early Warning Indicators
- Token count mismatches during validation checks
- Database transaction failures or rollbacks
- Memory usage spikes above 200MB threshold
- Migration process taking >50% longer than estimated
- Error rates >0.1% during bulk insert operations

#### Specific Mitigation Strategies
```python
# 1. Comprehensive Data Validation
def validate_migration_integrity():
    """Multi-level data validation during migration."""
    # Source validation: Verify JSONL file integrity
    # Transform validation: Check token count calculations
    # Target validation: Confirm database record accuracy
    # Cross-validation: Compare source totals with database totals

# 2. Atomic Transaction Management
def atomic_migration_batch():
    """Process migration in atomic batches with rollback capability."""
    # Use ClickHouse transactions for batch operations
    # Implement savepoints every 1000 records
    # Automatic rollback on validation failures
    
# 3. Real-time Monitoring
def migration_health_monitoring():
    """Continuous monitoring during migration process."""
    # Track token count accuracy (tolerance: 0.001%)
    # Monitor memory usage (alert at 150MB)
    # Database performance monitoring
    # Error rate tracking with escalation triggers
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Automated rollback to pre-migration state within 5 minutes
2. **Partial Recovery**: Resume migration from last valid checkpoint
3. **Alternative Migration Path**: Switch to incremental migration strategy
4. **Data Reconciliation**: Manual data verification and correction procedures

---

### Risk #2: Performance Degradation Under Load
- **Probability**: 7/10 (High)
- **Impact**: High
- **Category**: Performance/Technical
- **Description**: Bridge service may not meet <200ms storage requirement under production load, causing dashboard delays

#### Early Warning Indicators
- Response times consistently >150ms during testing
- Database connection pool exhaustion warnings
- Memory usage >150MB during normal operations
- CPU utilization >70% on database server
- Queue length for storage operations >100 pending

#### Specific Mitigation Strategies
```python
# 1. Performance Optimization
async def optimized_bulk_storage():
    """Implement high-performance bulk storage operations."""
    # Use ClickHouse async bulk insert capabilities
    # Implement connection pooling (max 10 connections)
    # Add request batching (1000 records per batch)
    # Use prepared statements for query optimization
    
# 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
class StorageCircuitBreaker:
    """Prevent cascade failures under high load."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.failure_threshold = 5

    # Intelligent routing based on operation type
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Performance Scaling**: Horizontal scaling of ClickHouse cluster
2. **Caching Implementation**: Redis cache for frequently accessed data
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Move heavy operations to background queues

        for attempt in range(self.max_retry_attempts):
            try:
                return await operation()
            except ConnectionError:

    # Store pending records in encrypted local files
    # Automatic sync when database connectivity restored
    # Maintain data integrity during offline period
```

#### Contingency Plans
1. **Database Failover**: Automatic failover to backup ClickHouse instance
2. **Local Storage Buffer**: Temporary local storage with sync on reconnection
3. **Service Degradation**: Continue read-only operations from cached data

        """Return token metrics with fallback to legacy data."""
        if self.migration_progress_threshold < 1.0:
            # Use hybrid approach: database + enhanced analysis

# 3. A/B Testing Framework
async def dashboard_ab_testing():
    """Test new vs old dashboard with real users."""
    # 10% traffic to new database-driven dashboard
    # 90% traffic to existing enhanced analysis dashboard
    # Performance and accuracy comparison metrics
```
